## Bet
As you can see, this is a very simple contract designed to keep simplicity in mind.
We are not going to deal with complex contract autosolving based on results, we will have just an oracle that feeds
the result into the contract and we mark the winners.
The contract has to be created using a precise term to resolve like 'Real Madrid - FCBarcelona',
something that everyone reading the contract terms can understand.
