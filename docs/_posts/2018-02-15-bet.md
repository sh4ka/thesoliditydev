## Bet contract
### Introduction
As you can see in [the source](https://github.com/sh4ka/thesoliditydev/blob/master/contracts/bet.sol), this one is a very straightforward contract designed to keep simplicity in mind.
We are not going to deal with complex contract autosolving based on results, we will have just an oracle that feeds
the result into the contract and we mark the winners.
The contract has to be created using a precise term to resolve like 'Real Madrid - FCBarcelona',
something that everyone reading the contract terms can understand.

### Features
We find again a contract using a list of states to keep track of contract behaviour. This is very useful to control how the contract is allowed to interact with its users.

In this contract we start using a very powerful feture, events. An event is what makes possible to a user frontend interface to react to actions. The syntax is pretty basic, you can read more about Events in the [official documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#events).
